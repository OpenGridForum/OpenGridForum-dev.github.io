# www-dev repository on github.com/opengridforum
Developmental version of content for public website for www.ogf.org

This website should be available as https://www-dev.ogf.org

To make this available, we followed the "custom domain" instructions in the instructions here: https://pages.github.com/

Once the content is settled, we can change the settings or create a branch to take this site live as a replacement for https://www.ogf.org

This is a sister site to https://github.com/OpenGridForum/ogf-historical-archives which is also available as https://archive.ogf.org


We may decide to use a Markdown generator. See: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll
